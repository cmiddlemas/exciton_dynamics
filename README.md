# exciton_dynamics
A package to compute Lindblad spectra and long-lived dynamics of exciton systems
with varying connection topologies.

Examples of use can be found in test_scripts and run_scripts. To use a newer
runscript, move it to the data folder (or somewhere else on the filesystem) and
run.

Requirements:
